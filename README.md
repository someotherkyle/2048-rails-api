# 2048-Rails-API


For my final project at Flatiron School, I challenged myself to recreate the 2048 game in React & Redux. Data is persisted in a Sqlite3 database connected through a Ruby on Rails API. This repo is the database and Ruby on Rails portion. The React and Redux front end is available (here)[https://github.com/someotherkyle/2048-react-front].

### Installation

Simply clone this repo, cd into it and run `bundle install`, `rails db:migrate` then `rails s`. Clone and start the accompanying React and Redux front end repository (here)[https://github.com/someotherkyle.com/2048-react-front]. 

### Contributions and Licensing

You are welcome to utilize any of the code in this repository. I did not create the game 2048, I merely challenged myself to reproduce it. As such, I would encourage anyone interested to create their own and use this code as a guide. Code contributions for this project would defeat the purpose of the challenge I set for myself but critiques and improvements are always welcome.
